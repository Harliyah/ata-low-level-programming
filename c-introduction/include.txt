The difference between #include <stdio.h> and #include “stdio.h” is that <stdio.h> checks the system directories directly and picks the stdio files while "stdio.h" checks the project folder to find the stdio.h file and if it doesn't see it, it follows the path if any else it falls back to check the system directory so basically the <> checks the system directory while "" checks the project folder.
